# :snake: Scientific Computing with Python - FreeCodeCamp

## About the Projects

This repository contains all my solutions to the Scientific Computing with Python course from FreeCodeCamp. All were made using only Python

## Project list:

- Arithmetic Formatter
- Time Calculator
- Budget App
- Polygon Area Calculator
- Probability Calculator

## Probability Calculator

For this project, I needed to write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat. I created a Hat class that the user, when creating a instance of the class, can decide how many balls are in the hat  and of which colors they are. Then there is a function to calculate the probability of picking a group of balls from an instance of the hat class
