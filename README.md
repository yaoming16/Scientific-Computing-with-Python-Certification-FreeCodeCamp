# :snake: Scientific Computing with Python - FreeCodeCamp

## About the Projects

This repository contains all my solutions to the Scientific Computing with Python course from FreeCodeCamp. All were made using only Python

## Project list:

- [Arithmetic Formatter](#arithmetic-formatter)
- [Time Calculator](#arithmetic-formatter)
- [Budget App](#arithmetic-formatter)
- [Polygon Area Calculator](#arithmetic-formatter)

## Arithmetic Formatter

This project consisted in creating a function that receives a sum or a substraction and arrenges it vertically. The function receives as a parameter the problems to arrenge and also can receive an optional parameter ( True or False) in case the user wants the results to be shown. 

### Example 

Input: 

`arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"])`

Output: 

```
   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
```
