# :snake: Scientific Computing with Python - FreeCodeCamp

## About the Projects

This repository contains all my solutions to the Scientific Computing with Python course from FreeCodeCamp. All were made using only Python

## Project list:

- Arithmetic Formatter
- Time Calculator
- Budget App
- Polygon Area Calculator
- Probability Calculator

## Polygon Area Calculator

This project consisted in creating a class called rectangle and a subclass of rectangle called square that inhereted methods and attributes. The Rectangle class includes methods to calculate area, perimeter, diagonal, print a picture and see how many times other shapes can fit inside.
