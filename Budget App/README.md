# :snake: Scientific Computing with Python - FreeCodeCamp

## About the Projects

This repository contains all my solutions to the Scientific Computing with Python course from FreeCodeCamp. All were made using only Python

## Project list:

- Arithmetic Formatter
- Time Calculator
- Budget App
- Polygon Area Calculator
- Probability Calculator

## Budget App

This project consisted in creating a class called Budget. It should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. When objects are created, they are passed in the name of the category. The class should have an instance variable called ledger that is a list. The class should also contain differents methods that will alter the budget. 

When the object is printed gives the following output:

```
*************Food*************
initial deposit        1000.00
groceries               -10.15
restaurant and more foo -15.89
Transfer to Clothing    -50.00
Total: 923.96
```

There is also a function called "create_spend_chart" that creates a chart showing spending from a list of categories that receives as parameters. Here is an example of the output:

```
Percentage spent by category
100|          
 90|          
 80|          
 70|          
 60| o        
 50| o
