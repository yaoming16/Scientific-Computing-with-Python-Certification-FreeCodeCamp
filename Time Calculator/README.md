# :snake: Scientific Computing with Python - FreeCodeCamp

## About the Projects

This repository contains all my solutions to the Scientific Computing with Python course from FreeCodeCamp. All were made using only Python

## Project list:

- Arithmetic Formatter
- Time Calculator
- Budget App
- Polygon Area Calculator
- Probability Calculator


## Time Calculator

This project consisted in creating a function receives as parameters a starting time and a duration time. It will return the starting time with the duration time added 

### Example 

Input: 

`add_time("11:43 PM", "24:20", "tueSday")`

Output: 

` # Returns: 12:03 AM, Thursday (2 days later) `
